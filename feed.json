				"content_html": "<p>Chrome Web Store policy allows ads in extensions, but can Google&rsquo;s ad products be used in browser extensions? Let&rsquo;s dig through some policy docs to find out.</p>\n<p>Someone  posted a question in the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-extensions\">chromium-extensions</a> Google Group a couple weeks ago asking whether they were allowed to use Google Ads in browser extensions. When I last looked into this I worked on the Chrome Extensions team and the short answer was &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t use Google&rsquo;s ad services, but you can use other services if the policies of those services allow it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Since then my relationship with this question has changed. Google and I have parted ways, I began building my <a href=\"https://incremental.software\">extension dev consultancy</a>, and I&rsquo;m looking for other revenue streams to diversify my income. In other words, this question is more relevant to me than ever before. So, let’s see if we can&rsquo;t get a hard answer.</p>\n<p>In this post we’ll be taking a look at a few different Google policy sites and seeing what (if anything) they have to say about browser extensions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chrome-web-store-policies\">Chrome Web Store policies</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by reviewing the Chrome Web Store’s <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies\">Program Policies</a>. The <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/ads/\">Ads policies</a> basically says that extensions can display ads as long as they conform to some specific requirements. One of those requirements immediately raises a red flag when it comes to inegrating Google ads.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Currently, AdSense may not be used to serve ads in Products, per <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182\">AdSense policies</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you do a web search for a set of terms like <code>chrome extension google ads</code> you&rsquo;ll probably see posts on StackOverflow where people quote this and throw up their hands. But this in itself isn&rsquo;t a prohibition; it&rsquo;s an attempt to summarize <em>someone else&rsquo;s</em> prohibition. Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t track down a primary source for this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"adsense-program-policies\">AdSense Program policies</h2>\n<p>Following AdSense Policies link takes us to the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182\">AdSense Program policies page</a> page. The first thing I do when trying to quickly grok something like this is search the page for relevant terms. The word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear anywhere on the this page and the word &ldquo;browser&rdquo; only appears twice. Looks like i&rsquo;ll actually have to dig into the text and try to divine the spirit of their meaning.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the blow-by-blow analysis and I&rsquo;ll summarize most of this page is just absolutely hammering home that Google <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want publishers (the site showing ads) to do an ad fraud. Beyond that, there are only a couple of passages related to the question we&rsquo;re trying to answer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ad placement</strong></p>\n<p>Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AdSense code may not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Publishers must also adhere to the policies for each product used. Please see our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1346295\">ad placement policies</a> article for more information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second sentence in this passage describes &ldquo;software&rdquo; as an inappropriate place to display AdSense ads. That&rsquo;s a pretty broad category, but writ large they appear to be saying that AdSense may only be used to monetize websites. To drive that point home they continue:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The use of &ldquo;including toolbars&rdquo; here is interesting. As previously mentioned, this document doesn&rsquo;t use the word &ldquo;extension,&rdquo; so this (dated) reference to Internet Explorer toolbars is about as close as we&rsquo;ll get and their stance seems clear.</p>\n<p>But to drive the point home, let&rsquo;s follow that &ldquo;ad placement policies&rdquo; link from the first quotation and see what they have to say.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ads in a software application</strong></p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Publishers are not permitted to distribute Google ads or AdSense for search boxes through software applications including<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but not limited to toolbars, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->browser extensions<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and desktop applications. AdSense code may only be implemented on web-based pages and approved WebView technologies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That&rsquo;s about as explicit a prohibition as I could imagine. But, I should note that the first paragraph of page explicitly identifies the page as covering &ldquo;Adsense ad placement policies.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s critical because didn&rsquo;t shut the door on Google Ads in extensions: there&rsquo;s an AdMob-shaped escape hatch we can look into.</p>\n<h2 id=\"admobs-behavioral-policies\">AdMob&rsquo;s Behavioral policies</h2>\n<p>AdMob is governed by the AdSense program policies, but with some additional exceptions and guidance for this specific product. On a side note, I don&rsquo;t know why they decided to name the page that provides that guidance &ldquo;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860\">Behavioral policies</a>&rdquo; rather than something like &ldquo;AdMob product policies&rdquo; but, well, there it is.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exceptions to AdSense policie</strong></p>\n<p>In principle, all AdMob publishers must follow our online program policies, however there are certain policies that differ between AdSense and AdMob. Please see the exceptions below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Ad placement&rdquo; presented a problem in the AdSense policies, so what does AdMob policy say?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ad placement</strong></p>\n<p>Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats, but must comply with the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9335564\">Google Publisher Policies</a>.

It does, however, contain the following guidance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Integrate the latest SDK</strong></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to always stay updated with the latest SDK (for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/admob/android/sdk\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/download\">iOS</a>), which will give you access to the latest ad formats, features, and bug fixes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This passage is interesting because it implies that SDK integration is important without explicitly saying it&rsquo;s required.</p>\n<p>So, <em>is</em> it required? Let&rsquo;s see what the AdSesne and AdMob policy pages have to say. The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/2753860\">AdMob policy</a> page references the this SDK and the fact that it&rsquo;s used to serve personalized ads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Personalized advertising</strong></p>\n<p>Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate interests and demographics (for example, &lsquo;sports enthusiasts&rsquo;).
